    /*Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) refers that a class, method or module must have just one responsibility.
    In other words, it must have just one reason to change. Sometimes we create classes, methods or modules that have too many responsibilities at once.
    For instance, sometimes you can have a class that has business logic, persistence logic, log register, all in the same class.
    This is a violation of SRP because the class is trying to do many things at once and a change in one of those responsibilities means all other responsibilities will be affected as well.

    The main objective of SRP is the separation of responsibilities and scope reduction when you introduce a change.*/
