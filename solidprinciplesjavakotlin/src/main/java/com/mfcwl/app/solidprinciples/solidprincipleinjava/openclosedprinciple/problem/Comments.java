    /*Software Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.*/

    /*Above definition is poorly phrased, Hence Bob Martin expanded this definition as follows
     * "You should be able to extend the behaviour of a system without having to modify that system"*/

    /*To understand this, Lets write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle.,
     * This program is not extendable, As we will not be able to calculate area of other
     * geometric figures.*/
